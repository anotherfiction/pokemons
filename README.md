# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

  Also, see .ruby-version file for the latest changes

  Standard boilerplate rails

  `bundle exec rake db:reset`

## Database initialization

  Includes `seeds.rb` which downloads the list of pokemons and types from the public pokemon API.

## How to run the test suite

  `bundle exec rspec spec` will run all specs

  `bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/spec:line` will run only selected specs

## Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

  No sidekiq. No cron. No redis. Just a simple pokemon project :D

## Deployment instructions
